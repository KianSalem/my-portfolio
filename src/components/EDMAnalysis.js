        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into electronic music began with the trumpet in 6th grade. Over the years, I
          learned to play guitar and piano, fueling a deep passion for music that led me to DJing
          and producing my own tracks. Combining this passion with my expertise in data analytics,
          I embarked on a project to explore how different elements of electronic music have evolved
          over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a Python script, I called Spotifyâ€™s API to collect data on nearly 1,000 electronic
          music hits from 2007 to 2022, exporting them into a CSV file. After importing the data
          into my AWS SQL server and cleaning it, I formulated several questions to analyze trends
          and patterns. Leveraging Power BI, I created visualizations to tell the story of EDM's
          evolution.
