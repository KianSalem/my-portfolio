        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into electronic music began with the trumpet in 6th grade. Over the years, I
          learned to play guitar and piano, fueling a deep passion for music that led me to DJing
          and producing my own tracks. Combining this passion with my expertise in data analytics,
          I embarked on a project to explore how different elements of electronic music have evolved
          over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a <strong>Python</strong> script, I called Spotifyâ€™s <strong>API</strong> to collect data on nearly 1,000 electronic
          music hits from 2007 to 2022, exporting them into a <strong>CSV</strong> file. After importing the data
          into my <strong>AWS SQL Server</strong> and cleaning it, I formulated several questions to analyze trends
          and patterns. Leveraging <strong>Power BI</strong>, I created visualizations to tell the story of EDM's
          evolution.

          <h3>1. Rising Tempo: The Beat Speeds Up</h3>
          <p>
            One of the first aspects I explored was how the average tempo of EDM tracks has changed
            over the years. A higher tempo often correlates with increased energy and excitement in
            music.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Finding:</strong> The average tempo of EDM tracks has gradually, but not linearly, <strong>decreased</strong> from
            2007 to 2022, indicating a trend toward more relaxed and slow-paced music.

  {/* Conclusion */}
  <div className="prologue">
        <h2>Key Takeways</h2>
        <p>
        This analysis of nearly 1,000 EDM tracks from 2007 to 2022 highlights significant trends in the genre's evolution.
        Notably, the average tempo has gradually decreased, moving towards more relaxed compositions, while danceability 
        peaked in 2008, emphasizing groove-oriented production. Despite these changes, loudness levels have remained 
        consistent, maintaining the genre's signature sound. The dominance of the Câ™¯ major key and the shift towards more 
        vocal-heavy tracks indicate a preference for harmonically rich and emotionally engaging music, contributing 
        to EDM's broadening appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
        Furthermore, the peak in popularity in 2021 underscores EDM's sustained mainstream success and its ability to adapt
        to changing musical tastes. The optimal danceable tempo range of 120-130 BPM and the experimentation with acoustic
        elements in 2020 demonstrate the genre's dynamic nature and willingness to innovate. These findings provide
        valuable insights for producers and artists, highlighting the key elements that drive audience engagement and
        ensuring that EDM continues to thrive in the evolving musical landscape.
